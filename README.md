# goteplan
Unofficial Noteplan Command Line Utility

This is an unofficial app to manage NotePlan notes from the command line. It should be able to compile for any operating system supporting the Go language.

NOTE: The first time you run this, you should specify the argument -b <root of noteplan docs>. This will be saved to the config file. Absolute or relative pathing can be used.
